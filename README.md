# HTML-AAM
HTML Accessibility API Mappings (html-aam) developed by the [Web Applications Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2019/webapps/) (previously the [Web Platform Working Group](http://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/)). It is the basis of the [Editor's Draft version of the specification](https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/).  You can also compare against [the most recent published version](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/).

This specification was part of the [ARIA suite](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/deliverables). General information about editing the specification is in the [main ARIA repository readme](https://github.com/w3c/aria/).
